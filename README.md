# Dataset Electrothermal Deformation Characterization for Samsung 30Q Cell
Dataset for the Samsung 30Q battery for electro-thermal and deformation characterization

The Samsung 30Q is a high-performance lithium-ion cell widely used in various applications, including e-bikes, power tools, and other high-drain devices. Cycling refers to the process of charging and discharging the battery repeatedly.

## Key Features of the Samsung 30Q:
- **Capacity**: 3000mAh
- **Nominal Voltage**: 3.6V
- **Max Continuous Discharge Current**: 15A

Cycle Life:
   - The battery is rated for around 300-500 cycles with minimal capacity loss under optimal conditions.
   - Proper care can extend its lifespan.

## Dataset
The dataset consists of three cells, each at:
 - Room temperature for for discharge rates C/10, 1C, 2C, 3C, and 4C
 - Room temperature, 30, 40, and 50 Â°C for 1C discharge and High Power Pulse Characterization (In Progress)
 - The monitored data includes current, voltage, temperature, and Hoop strain with respect to time

## Data Visualization
The plotting folder contains codes in both MATLAB and python that can be used to plot data

The following figures were created in MATLAB using the Rate_Compare.m file
